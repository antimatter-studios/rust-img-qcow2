//! Read path: virtual offset -> L1 -> L2 -> host offset -> file read.
//!
//! Supported now:
//! - Uncompressed clusters, read and written
//! - Zlib-compressed clusters (raw deflate per the spec), read
//! - Zstd-compressed clusters (v3 `compression_type = 1`), read
//! - Backing-file chain (recursive, only when opened by path — the
//!   on-device API has no path context to resolve a parent against),
//!   with copy-up when a write lands on a cluster the parent supplies
//! - Sparse / v3 zero-flagged clusters
//! - Cluster allocation and refcount maintenance
//!
//! Not yet:
//! - Internal snapshots, encryption, external data file, extended L2
//! - Writing compressed clusters: a write to a compressed cluster
//!   allocates an uncompressed one in its place.
//!
//! ## Backing storage
//!
//! The reader is generic over [`fs_core::BlockDevice`]. Open from a path
//! via [`Qcow2Reader::open`] / [`Qcow2Reader::open_rw`] (the file is
//! wrapped in a [`fs_core::FileDevice`] internally), or hand in any
//! other `BlockDevice` via [`Qcow2Reader::open_on_device`] /
//! [`Qcow2Reader::open_rw_on_device`]. The on-device variants are how
//! the qcow2 layer stacks on top of an FSKit-supplied block resource,
//! a slice reader, or any other host-managed device.
